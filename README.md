# Netflix Streaming Pipeline

Designed a Netflix streaming data pipeline which implements a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using Azure Data Lake and Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) to process, transform, and serve data for analytics and reporting. It follows modern data engineering best practices with a Lakehouse approach.

### Tools and Technologies Used:<br>
* Azure Databricks.<br>
* Azure Data Factory(ADF).<br>
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2(ADLS Gen 2).<br>
* Pyspark.<br>
* Spark SQL.<br>
* Delta Live Tables.<br>

## Project description
### Bronze Table
Developed a bronze table(which contains data in raw format) by ingesting data into Azure Data Lake Storage using Azure Data Factory.<br>
* Purpose: Ingest raw, unprocessed data from various sources.<br>
* Sources:<br>
  * Files from cloud storage (Azure Blob): Data is incrementally loaded using Autoloaders.<br>
  * APIs: Data from web(Github account) is ingested to the bronze table using ADF pipeline.<br>
* Processing Type: Incremental data loads.<br>
* Tool used: Azure Data Factory.<br>
* Storage: Data is ingested into a Data Lake in its original format.<br>

### Silver Table(transformed data)
* Purpose: Clean and enrich data to make it query-ready.
* Transformations Include:
  * Data cleaning and deduplication
  * Type casting and formatting
  * Applying business rules
* Tool Used: Pyspark in Azure Databricks
* Storage: Transformed data is written back to the Data Lake in Delta format.<br>

### Gold Table(Serving data)
* Purpose: Provide aggregated and business-ready data for analytics and reporting.
* Processing Includes:
  * Data aggregation and summarization
  * Business KPIs computation
  * Dimensional modeling (facts and dimensions)
* Storage: Clean, ready-to-use data stored in Delta Tables in the Data Lake.
* Use Case: Consumed by downstream tools like:
  * Azure Synapse Analytics.
  * Power BI Dashboards.
